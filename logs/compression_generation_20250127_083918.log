2025-01-27 08:39:18,188 - INFO - Original (45 words): Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

2025-01-27 08:39:26,809 - INFO - Original (40 words): trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

2025-01-27 08:39:36,797 - INFO - Original (47 words): A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\uparrow\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\downarrow\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\uparrow\rangle and |\downarrow\rangle are the eigenstates of \sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings
