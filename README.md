## SPAR Trial Task

### By Bryan Sukidi

Here's my research process from start to finish! This will be a live document that I update as I go; I'll also provide a final write-up at the end. Hopefully this is helpful for a getting a sense of my research process.

Before I start, let's clarify the goal: we want to know *how much* model performance deteriorates on the GPQA-diamond dataset when we compress questions.

There are a couple questions you could ask:

1. How should we go about compression?
2. GPQA-diamond: graduate-level questions, 
3. One of the difficulties is that questions have varying levels of complexity;

**Predicted Difficulties:**




**Future Directions**
- *Control for initial difficulty of the problem*

Suppose you have two questions that are conceptually similar in difficulty, but one just has more essential information than the other. I would theorize that question 

Some of the questions just have more essential information than others;
