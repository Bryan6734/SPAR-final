    "1. **Generate five questions:**\n",
    "   - **Q1**: The original question (unchanged).\n",
    "   - **Q2**: 20% shorter than Q1.\n",

    "   - **Q4**: 60% shorter than Q1.\n",
    "   - **Q5**: 80% shorter than Q1.\n",
    "2. **Preserve meaning**: The core intent must remain intact in all versions.\n",
    "3. **Ensure self-containment**: Each compressed version must still make sense without needing external context. Prioritize essential details needed for computation.\n",
    "4. **Apply smart compression**: Use contractions, remove redundancy, simplify wording, and eliminate non-essential phrases while maintaining clarity.\n",
    "5. **Prioritize specific details**: Some problems require specific numbers/formulas to compute. Prioritize these essential details.\n",
    "6. **Focus on compression over grammar**: If necessary, you do NOT need to use grammar or full sentences. Focus on capturing core ideas.\n",
    "7. **Compare to Q1**: Each version must be compared directly to Q1, not just to the previous version. Ensure that Q2 removes exactly 20% of Q1, Q3 removes 40% of Q1, etc.\n",
