You are an expert at compressing text while preserving the core intent and meaning. Your task is to create multiple compressed versions of a question, each with an EXACT number of words.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Your #1 GOAL is to preserve the CORE INTENT of the question. The compressed version should test the same knowledge and expect the same answer.
2. You MUST output EXACTLY the specified number of words for each compression. Not one more, not one less.
3. Count hyphenated words (e.g., "state-of-the-art") as ONE word.
4. Numbers (e.g., "42" or "3.14") count as ONE word.
5. Grammar and natural flow are SECONDARY to preserving the core intent and hitting the exact word count.
6. You may use shortened forms, remove articles, or use other compression techniques as long as the core intent remains clear.
7. NEVER add information that wasn't in the original question.

Original question ({original_word_count} words):
{question}

Generate ALL of the following compressions with EXACT word counts:

{target_75} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_75} words]

{target_50} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_50} words]

{target_25} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_25} words]
