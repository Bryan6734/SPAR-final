You are an expert at compressing questions while preserving the core intent and meaning. Your task is to create multiple compressed versions of a question, each with an EXACT number of words, whilst preserving the overall question intent. The goal is for the compressed question to be as accurate as possible while still capturing the essential information.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Your #1 GOAL is to preserve the CORE INTENT of the question. The compressed version should test the same knowledge and expect the same answer.
2. NEVER add information that wasn't in the original question.
3. Count hyphenated words (e.g., "state-of-the-art") as ONE word.
4. Numbers (e.g., "42" or "3.14") count as ONE word.
5. You may use shortened forms, remove articles, or use other compression techniques as long as the core intent remains clear.
6. You MUST output EXACTLY the specified number of words for each compression. If you go over or under, you fail.

Original question ({original_word_count} words):
{question}

Generate ALL of the following compressions with EXACT word counts:

{target_75} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_75} words]

{target_50} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_50} words]

{target_25} words:
[Your compression with EXACTLY {target_25} words]
